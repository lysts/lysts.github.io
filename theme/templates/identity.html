<h3>About me.</h3>
<p>Originally a pupil of neuroscience, I am a full-stack software developer, passionate about creating thought-evocative, interactive, and informative digital tools for any purpose,<br>
Rather than letting technology engulf me, I have strived to develop a stable relationship with technology, by seeing its positive impact as science communication or online learning tools during the pandemic era.</p>

<p>I am also an audiophile, with a violin at hand wherever I go.<br>
Insects are my favourite animals and I find great joy in capturing them in art.</p>
<p>I am also an avid walker, to bump into scenic natural landscapes and urban shapes <br> —— free art inspiration.</p>

<p>Hailing from Japan, I was born in the concrete jungle, Tokyo, on a street adorned with a thick veil of sakura trees. <br>
Now, I find myself on the other side of the planet, in North London.</p>


<h3>This internet garden.</h3>
<p>Deployed with GitHub Pages and Pelican, this is a static website where blog post content is saved as reStructuredText files.<br>
This website is a reflection of my learning and a place to connect with others (say hi! email <a href="lyla.taguma@gmail.com">here</a>). 
<br>*fun fact*, the website logo is a mixture of my initials embodying a waveform which represents my ties with my island roots, Hawaii and Japan.

<h3>About me.</h3>
<p>Originally a pupil of neuroscience, I am a software developer and designer, passionate about creating thought-evocative, intuitive, and informative digital tools for any purpose,<br>
Rather than letting technology engulf us, I strive to develop a stable relationship with technology, by focusing on the positive impact it can have or has had, during the pandemic era.<br>
I love how it is a medium through which creatives can communicate across physical and linguistical borders, with visual, auditory, and even tactile experiences.</p>

<p>I am also an audiophile, with a violin at my side wherever I go.<br>
Insects and botany are fascinating to observe or capture in art.</p>
<p>On a weekend, I am an avid walker or climber, bumping into scenic natural or urban landscapes <br> —— free art inspiration.</p>

<p>Hailing from Japan, I was born in the "concrete jungle", Tokyo, on a street adorned with a polytunnel of sakura trees. <br>
Now, I find myself on the other side of the planet, in North London.</p>


<h3>This internet garden.</h3>
<p>Deployed with GitHub Pages and Pelican, this is a static website where blog post content is saved as reStructuredText files.<br>
This website is a reflection of my learning and a place to connect with others (say hi! email <a href="lyla.taguma@gmail.com">here</a>). 
<br>*fun fact*, the website logo is a mixture of my initials embodying a waveform which represents my ties with my island roots, Hawaii and Japan.

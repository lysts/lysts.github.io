        <h1>2024 Roadmap</h1>
        <h2>Quick documentation of the last 6 months and the tentative plans toward pursuing a career in software development.</h2>

        <p>I graduated in July, with a biomedical sciences degree with an honours in neuroscience. My final months in academia were spent adjusting to a professional lab, sprint-teaching myself Python and data science skills to conduct my research and contribute to a data analysis pipeline.</p>
        <p>It was rewarding, being able to apply the knowledge I had collected throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Intensely hands-on, I celebrated interdisciplinary collaboration and the practise of science. I also learned of the hardships and joys of science-dedicated career options. I was unexpectedly and rapidly drawn to the creative process of providing programming tools for facilitating our research, such as data visualisation. After speaking to informaticians, creative coders, and software engineers, I decided to put my endeavours of doing a phD aside to pursue a career in tech.</p>
        <p>After an intense period of job hunting and familiarising myself with the industry, I decided to focus my energy on learning on front-end engineering.</p>
        <p>As of December 4th, I managed to complete about 25% of the online bootcamp described below within 1.5 weeks. Considering this progression rate, as well as time taken to practise and create portfolio projects, I envision myself completing the course by the end of February. Here is what has best worked for me: <a href="#">a learning process</a></p>

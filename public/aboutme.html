<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Originally a neuroscience pupil, I am a front-end software developer, passionate about creating simple, animated, interactive, and informative digital tools for educational and creative purposes, inspired by the science communication and the uses of online learning from the pandemic era.</p>

<p>I am also an audiophile, with a violin at hand wherever I go. Insects are my favourite animals and I find great joy in capturing them in art. I am also avid walker, with a love for bumping into scenic natural landscapes and also urban fun finds.</p>

<p>Originally from Japan, I was born in the concrete jungle, Tokyo, on a street adorned with a tunnel of sakura trees. Now, I find myself on the other side of the planet, in North London.</p>

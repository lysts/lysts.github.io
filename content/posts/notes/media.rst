Films
=====
* Poor Things
    - encapsulates the beauty of being unapologetically oneself, as well as conventional societal "norms" and how they affect our behaviour.
    - watched early 2024
* Pig
    - poetic, quiet in dialogue but beautifully shot and emotionally gripping.
    - watch as Nicholas Cage desperately tries to reunite with his truffle pig.
    - watched summer 2022.
* 12 Angry Men
    - a powerful film about social justice
    - 90% of this film, was set in one room
    - black and white film that truly captures the dangers of human bias, discrimmination, and lack of critical thinking in something as life-changing as imprisonment.
    - one man questions the truth, against 11 men
* Women Talking
    - as an AFAB human, I resonated with the pain and anger the women in the film experienced, albeit their society being more heavily burdened by mysoginistic men and the expectations, rules, and restrictions that they have imposed on their lifestyle and life choices. 
    - set mostly in a barn where women and children of a small community in the USA, open up about the atrocities they have experienced throughout their lifetimes as they are left with little time and space to decide whether or not to part with their home for freedom.

Much of the following rules and notes are of **The Minimalists** ideas.

everything you own falls into "essentials", "nonessentials", or "junk"

Rules
-----

1.  90/90 (used last 90, will use next 90?) = “seasonality rule” covers seasons; spring = autumn
    
2.  1 in 10 out trains letting go muscles
    
3.  20/20 = replace item let go of for <£20 within 20 mins of location “Just in case rule”
    
4.  emergency items = handful of JIC items to keep: ex first-aid kit, jumper cables, water, tire chains, emergency blanket (depends on location)
    
5.  just for when = toilet paper, toothpaste
    
6.  30/30 “wait for it” = anything costing >30, get by without for next 30 hrs? if >100, wait 30 days - assess value to life; intentional acquisition!
    
7.  don’t upgrade = electronics, don’t upgrade if you don’t need to if they break:
    
    1.  go without
    2.  repair it
    3.  replace it
    
8.  10/10 material possessions theory Geoffrey Miller evo psych (Sex, Evolution, & Consumer Behaviour)
    
    1.  list 10 most expensive possessions - anything owned last 10 yrs
    2.  list top 10 most valued - can include experiences
    
    see what’s in common
    
9.  selling deadline = sunk-cost fallacy if behaviour pushes you to do things that are making you unhappy/worse, 30 days to do what you can to get rid of stuff, otherwise time more valuable ([donationtown.org](http://donationtown.org))
    
10.  spontaneous combustion = feel good for sth to spontaneously combust?, delete! for all aspects of life
    
11.  willing to walk = if house burning, loved ones + irreplaceable things… not forming too much attachment, don’t let happiness depend on sth you may lose
    
12.  minimalist gifting = love is transcendent, not transactional, contribution is a love language, bottomless empathy, “presence is the best present”; experiences - more value than material gifts
    
13.  minimalist gift getting = tell people about the experiences/local places/favourite charities etc

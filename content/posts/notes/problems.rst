Many things to fix...:

1. content is ultra-scrollable horizontally (yeek), rather than fitting within the width of a mobile device.
2. Weirdly, the footer is further away from left edge than the content itself
3. There is still an overlap issue with the footer and content at the bottom

Working on it!

It could be interesting to explore ``elm`` by Matthew Griffiths for more
intuitive css-specific design. Caveat.. Javascript - would bulk page:(

Would also be worth running rough and black on code!

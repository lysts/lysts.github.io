    <h1>12 (Banal) Facts About My Existence</h1>
    

    <p>Writing this made me realise how easily two decades of life can be summed up in a myriad of facts:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><cite>growth</cite> and <cite>community</cite> are my grounding keywords.</li>
<li>I was raised amidst a 200m tunnel of sakura trees with the dense concrete walls of metropolitan Tokyo and occasionally the flora, fauna, and incessant mud of Hawaii's suburban islands.</li>
<li>I used to want to be a taxidermist, osteologist, or pathologist, then realised that I was more interested in the behaviour of living things, and specifically the brain.</li>
<li>After 3 years of begging for a violin, my family doned me the instrument and I became a musicophile (unhealthily so; all of my writings were music therapy related by the end of my sweet adolescence).</li>
<li>Despite my interests in music and neuroscience, I chose to pursue a bioscience degree at the College of Science &amp; Engineering, and later, biomedical sciences, only to end up &quot;full circle&quot; in Anatomy &amp; Development, and later, a neuroscience lab researching perception and learning at the end of my studies.</li>
<li>I programmed for fun one summer in my childhood but never revisited it after somehow convincing myself that I wouldn't ever use the skill in the future. It was only towards the end of my degree which involved a heap of statistical testing, did I begin programming for fun and work.</li>
<li>My parents and grandparents and I like to build or create things from various mediums. My recent favourite way to explore art are game jams and pyrography. My current challenge is arduino and LED lights.</li>
<li>I believe that food should be consumed from a collection of small bowls, if not hand-holdable. My favourite utensils are small spoons or wooden chopsticks. There's nothing more satisfying than getting seconds and having a variety of food at the table. Being an avid food lover, it encourages me to eat slowly and mindfully, and avoid food comas.</li>
<li>I have a special place in my heart for insects and fungi. My childhood hobby was to:
* create an ant farm between two pieces of glass to watch the innerworkings of ant colonies and feed them honey nut cheerios. 100s of them later escaped and wreaked havoc in the house, which is probably I never attempted it again.
* care for a series of larvae, of butterflies, Japanese rhinoceros beetles, and cicadas, my favourite parts being feeding them dead leaves, lemon leaves, and fruit jelly, and watching them metamorphosise at every stage, even the chrysalis.</li>
<li>My favourite travel destination may be Santa Sabina in Rome, Italy. It is surrounded by an orange orchard and an incredible view of the city. Often adorned with live music by the locals, it's also a very quiet space for reflective thought and getting a good dose of sunlight. I wouldn't dare gatekeep this place or <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/qaAWKcy5B8w?si=WLfSnbavLtHDfwlf">the piece</a> which led me to it.</li>
<li>Historically a hoarder, after exploring why minimalism has made a corpulent number of people happy, I now realise why I miss having that distraction free and classic 3rd generation ipod shuffle, and that I can say no, let go, or walk away from people and places that no longer serve me growth and joy. I am still very much an extremely sentimental and nostalgic person but I also realised that even if you love everything around you, if your intuition is telling you to try something new, it's often good to listen and follow it. You can carry a bit of what makes you happy. You will always carry the people who you've loved and what you learned from them through every stage of your life.</li>
<li>It took me becoming independent at 17, moving myself to a country where I had no family, experiencing a whole new culture, and meeting hundreds of people, to realise that it's possible to build communities of people who truly share the same values and attitudes to life and happiness.</li>
</ol>
